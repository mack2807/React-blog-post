React Blog Post Project

This repository contains a React blog post project that showcases the usage of the Context API for managing state across components. The project is built using ReactJS and demonstrates the three main phases of using the Context API: creating a context, providing values with a provider, and consuming those values within components.

Project Overview
This project is a simple blog post application developed using ReactJS.
The primary focus of this project is to illustrate the implementation of the Context API to manage state and data sharing among different components.
Context API
The Context API is a part of React that enables the sharing of state data between components without the need for passing props explicitly at every level.
In this project, the Context API is used to manage the state of the blog posts and user information.
Implementation Details
Create Context:

A context is created using the createContext function from React.
The context holds the initial state for the blog posts and user information.
Provider:

A provider component is created using the context created earlier.
The provider wraps the entire application or a specific part of it, providing the state and functions to manipulate the state as values to its descendants.
Consume:

Components that need access to the shared state consume the context using the useContext hook.
This allows components to access and use the shared state and functions without having to pass them down through props.
